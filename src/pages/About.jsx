                  Hi, I'm Satyam Mishra, the creator and developer behind The Royale. With a passion for programming and
                  a love for fine dining, I combined my expertise in technology with my appreciation for culinary arts to
                  create this virtual culinary experience. My journey into web development began during my studies in
                  Electronics and Communication Engineering, where I discovered my knack for building digital solutions
                  that marry functionality with aesthetics.
